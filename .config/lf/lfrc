# Dther's lfrc
# (c) 2021 Rudy Dellomas III, no warranty, no evil allowed.
# Comments on things I feel like I'd forget,
# but lf has a real nice manpage at lf(1).
# Assumes that we're running on a UNIX-like system. Bets are off on Windows.

# XXX: REQUIRED PROGRAMS
# For this to work, you must install:
#  - trash-cli(1)
#  - GNU readlink(1)
#  - BSD file(1)
#  - preview.sh, which is in my dotfiles repo (~/bin)

# visual settings
set scrolloff 5

# ALWAYS USE 'sh' for reliable behaviour
set shell '/bin/sh'
# exit on error and error on unset variables
set shellopts '-eu'

# open files using $EDITOR if they're text,
# otherwise use a file opener...
# $OPENER is set automatically by lf. (xdg-open on linux)
# Doesn't call `setsid` if only one file is being opened,
# to allow the terminal to be swallowed by dwm(1).
