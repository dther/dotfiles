# Dther's trash ~/bin/

Throwaway scripts which I'm working on but still use on the regular
go here.
Symlinks to WIP scripts too.

Generally things stick here until they're big enough to merit their own repository,
or are eventually moved into `~/.local/bin/` if I think I'm never going to touch them again.
